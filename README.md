### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’» I am a member of kubernetes, a code contributor to several cncf projects, and a code contributor to golang/go

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: å½¦ç¥–

âš¡ I hope to contribute code to all the OSS (Open Source Software) I have used.

You may have seen me submit pr for a large number (>100) of projects, sorry, I'm not that familiar with these projects, this is just to help fix some simple issues for these projects along the way when verifying https://github.com/golang/go/issues/53968

I do find that open source projects are not the same as each other, there are some that are not friendly and some that do not expect outside contributions.
