### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’» I am a member of kubernetes, a code contributor to several cncf projects, and a code contributor to golang/go

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: å½¦ç¥–

âš¡ I hope to contribute code to all the OSS (Open Source Software) I have used.

---
With the opportunity to verify https://github.com/golang/go/issues/53968, I have submitted code to many projects.(Not an uncommon experience)

The contrast shows the differences of each project even more.

- Some OSS do not accept external contributions(unusual, but reasonable): [cube2222/octosql](https://github.com/cube2222/octosql) | [piotrnar/gocoin](https://github.com/piotrnar/gocoin)

- Some OSS I will personally never submit code to again(Blacklist): [PufferPanel/PufferPanel](https://github.com/PufferPanel/PufferPanel)
